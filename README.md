## Install :wrench:

* Clone the repo and run ``yarn`` or ``npm install``

* To create the **docker** container based on the `ormconfig.example.json` we can do: ``docker run --name templateDB -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=docker -p 5432:5432 -d postgres``. To access the database you can use [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/). Highly recommended.

## thoughts and considerations

check out the ``concept.md`` for more information about the thought process I've had.
