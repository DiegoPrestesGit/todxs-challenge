# thoughts and considerations

_I believe this challenge is quite open for imagination, so I'll make use of it._

- there will be a small CRUD for the user;
- we will need the CPF, name, rought monthly income, average monthly expense and Serasa Score;

- the proposal of the **available amount**, **interest rate** and **number of installments** will be based in the the user's profile, and he will be rewarded by having a great score (I believe we should reward good deeds);
- 300 points or less on Serasa Score is very bad, between 300 and 700 points you are average, 700 or more points you are fine and over 900 points your name is as clean as a whistle;

- the **available amount** and **number of installments** is influenced by the difference between the **averageMonthlyIncome** and the **averageMonthlyExpense**;
- the **available amount** is also influenced by the **Serasa Score**;
- the **interest rate** is influenced by the **Serasa Score** and the **number of installments**;

- We could continue with ideas and increase the scope of challenge, but I like to simplify;
