# thoughts and considerations

_I believe this challenge is quite open for imagination, so I'll make use of it._

- there will be a small CRUD for the user;
- we will need the CPF, name, rought monthly income, average monthly expense and Serasa Score;

- the proposal of the **available amount**, **interest rate** and **number of installments** will be based in the the user's profile, and he will be rewarded by having a great score (I believe we should reward good deeds).

- We could continue with ideas and increase the scope of challenge, but I like to simplify.
